/**
 * ------------------------------------------Structure--------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Before I start coding use object - oriented programming, I define my derived class LingRongSyu,
 * it has two variables. character variable represent my role in my life. Activities variable is a hashmap type, 
 * which used time as key in order to mapping each activity percentage of time I spent. Than I created two child classes.
 * One of the class, LingRongSyuPast, which is define what I done in the past six months. Another one, LingRongSyuFuture,
 * which is define what would like to learn in the next six months.
 * _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
 *
 * I implemented java inheritance in order to reuse my code.If I want to add some function in child class, it won't 
 * affect my Derived class. Besides inheritance, I create HashMap type as activities container. Therefore, if I want to
 * query how many time I spend on activities, the time complexity only O(1).
